/**
 * Handles the game server's `POST /api/internal/game-sessions/{sessionId}/ended`.
 *
 * Without it a finished game closes nothing: the game server only flips `user_status` back to
 * `Online` and the lobby ticket stays `MATCHED`, which makes the next enqueue silently return
 * the old ticket instead of queueing. [MatchedTicketReconciler] would eventually notice, but
 * only after `matched-scan-grace` plus a scan interval - a minute of a player pressing a
 * button that does nothing.
 *
 * The notification is a shortcut, never the only path. Every check here fails closed: an
 * unrecognised session, a stale sender or a ticket that moved on all leave the reconciler to
 * reach the same verdict on its own schedule.
