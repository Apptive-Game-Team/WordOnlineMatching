/**
 * Decides whether the session behind a `MATCHED` ticket still exists.
 *
 * Two independent signals, cheapest first:
 *
 * 1. Boot generation. A game server keeps its sessions in memory only, so a process that
 *    restarted took them with it. The id the ticket recorded at match time versus the id
 *    the server row publishes now proves that without any network call - and it stays
 *    correct even when the restarted process is already answering health checks again.
 * 2. Session query against the hosting server. Authoritative when the host answers.
 *
 * The same two signals also separate a finished game from a lost one. A host that is
 * provably the process which accepted the session and reports the session gone has simply
 * finished it ([SessionLiveness.ENDED]); anything else that ends a session is a loss.
 *
 * Every inconclusive path collapses to [SessionLiveness.UNKNOWN]. A missing id on either
 * side is an older game server build, not evidence of a restart - and not proof of same
 * process either, so it downgrades a finished game to [SessionLiveness.LOST] rather than
 * claiming a clean ending it cannot see.
